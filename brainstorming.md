### App Evaluation: Twitter Clone

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** Optimized for mobile but can also be availble on web.
- **Story:** Users can utilize a Twitter account to send updates to their friends, view their friends' updates, and interact with them
- **Market:** Any person of all ages, but particularly ages 17-39
- **Habit:** Checked on a notification basis if users opt-in to stay updated on their friends' lives
- **Scope:** V1 fetches tweets and the user can post their own tweet. V2 would allow liking, retweeting, and sharing. V3+ can focus on embedding videos and asynchronous updates

### App Evaluation: Unsplash Client

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Category:** Photography
- **Mobile:** Optimized for mobile but can also work on web
- **Story:** User can look through different photo options from Unsplash, based on a search prompt, and can download any desired photos
- **Market:** Any photography enthusiasts or content creators seeking high quality stock images
- **Habit:** Not much of a focus as interaction is at the discretion of the user
- **Scope:** V1 achieves its intended purpose. V2 allows for more interaction with the photos. V3 can allow users to sign in and post their photos to Unsplash.

### App Evaluation: Location Reminder App

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Category:** Tools and Productivity
- **Mobile:** Optimized for mobile as it has geo-location capabilities
- **Story:** Create a reminder and have the app push a notification to the user's device when in-bound of a particular location's radius
- **Market:** Any active working person with a busy schedule, ideally age 17-59
- **Habit:** Depends if the user wants to have recurring reminders, but primarily not habit-based
- **Scope:** V1 would achieve its intended function only. V2 will add recurring reminders. V3 and beyond will integrate any data analytics based on task completion and location
